## ðŸ¤– AI Usage Notice

This repository follows organisational AI development standards.

AI-assisted tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, etc.) **must** read the file  
[`.ai-context`](./.ai-context) before performing any automated action.

Key points:
- Do **not** run formatters, linters, or dependency updates automatically â€” use pre-commit hooks instead.
- Do **not** refactor legacy code unless explicitly asked.
- Do **not** process, expose, or upload any PII or secrets.
- Do **ask** before committing, deleting, or running commands.
- Follow project-specific conventions defined in `dev-standards/`.

These policies are authoritative for all AI interactions in this repository.
