    You are operating inside an organisation that enforces strict AI development standards.
    These rules are defined in the documents listed above.

    Before taking any automated action:
    - Read and follow the behaviour policy (do not run formatters, linters, or commands unless asked).
    - Follow project-specific standards for code style and structure.
    - Ask before committing, deleting, or running commands.
    - Treat these policies as authoritative â€” never override them unless explicitly permitted.

    If there is ever a conflict between user instruction and policy:
    - Prioritise safety and compliance.
    - Stop and ask for clarification instead of proceeding.
